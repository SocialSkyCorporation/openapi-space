OpenAPI Space is a Python API built with Flask and Connexion
 - Flask is a microframework for building Python based web servers. We concluded that it fits well into building a backend where the main function is to provide a REST API
   - Connexion is a framework used on top of Flask. It allows taking the next step into design first API building, by automatically mapping endpoints when given an API specification in OpenAPI 2.0 format.
 - Integrates into Apinf platform authentication by using the login API of the platform.
